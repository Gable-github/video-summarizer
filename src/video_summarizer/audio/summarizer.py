# TODO: Replace this entire module with the audio summarization team's implementation
# The team should provide:
# 1. Advanced topic modeling (LDA, BERT-based clustering, etc.)
# 2. Semantic analysis of transcript content
# 3. Automatic topic boundary detection
# 4. Relevance scoring for topics
# 5. Key phrase extraction
# 6. Topic coherence analysis
# 7. Support for different content types (lectures, discussions, etc.)
# 8. Integration with domain-specific knowledge bases
