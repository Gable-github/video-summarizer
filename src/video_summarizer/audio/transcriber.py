# TODO: Replace this entire module with the audio transcription team's implementation
# The team should provide:
# 1. Advanced speech recognition (Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text, etc.)
# 2. Speaker diarization (identifying different speakers)
# 3. Accurate timestamp alignment
# 4. Confidence scoring for transcription quality
# 5. Support for multiple languages
# 6. Noise handling and audio quality assessment
# 7. Punctuation and formatting
# 8. Technical term recognition and correction
